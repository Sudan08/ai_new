          The AI Learners Community, a branch of Herald DevCorps, was established in 2019 by Mr.Shreejan Shrestha, Ms.Erin Shakya and Ms.Shristi Shakya. 

          The roots of formation of community lies back in the years 2017-2018 when AI came into hype in Nepal but due to less exposure in early stages our founders collectively form AI Learners Community to encourage and aspire students on the topic of Artificial intelligence by learning together and sharing what we know through a common platform.
